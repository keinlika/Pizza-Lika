# Pizza Lika Order Form

## Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with this project was to build a dynamic and interactive web application for ordering pizzas. The application allows users to select pizzas, dynamically calculate the total cost, and validate their input for accuracy. By using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, I wanted to create a seamless user experience, making sure the user input is validated.

This project not only helped me gain hands-on experience with these technologies, but also reinforced the importance of form validation, dynamic content updates, and responsive design.

## Development Environment

This software was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Languages**: 
  - **HTML** for structuring the content.
  - **CSS** for styling and layout design.
  - **JavaScript** for client-side interactivity and dynamic total calculation.
  - **PHP** for handling server-side logic and form processing.
  
- **Text Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code for coding and editing files.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for version control and project management.
- **Web Browser**: Chrome for testing and debugging the application.

## Features

- **Dynamic Price Calculation**: Users can select pizza items, and the total price is automatically calculated based on their choices.
- **Form Validation**: The form validates user input, including phone numbers, credit card information, and pizza selection, to ensure accuracy and security.

## Useful Websites

These resources were invaluable in helping me throughout the development process:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Comprehensive documentation for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - A helpful source for tutorials and examples on web development technologies.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - A community-driven platform for troubleshooting and finding solutions to coding problems.

This version better reflects the use of PHP along with the front-end technologies and emphasizes the projectâ€™s features and purpose more clearly.
